# MICTIC-ExcelTemplate
This repository contains a .xlsx template for MICTIC which is an attribution framework.

MICTIC stands for the data sources that analysts should cover: malware, infrastructure, control severs, telemetry, intelligence and cui bono.

"Good attribution should cover all aspects of an attack."

Inspired by Timo Steffens' book: Attribution of Advanced Persistent Threats, I have created this excel template that includes space for keeping notes for each of MICTIC's aspect, as also to create hypothesis, reference pottential relevant countries and groups, in a likelihood scale based on your notes.

I hope you find it useful!
